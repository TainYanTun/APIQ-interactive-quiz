   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_DATABASE=quiz_app
   
   # Redis Configuration
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=
   
   # Application URLs
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3001
   
   # Admin Credentials (for initial setup)
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   # Create the database
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE quiz_app;"
   
   # Run migrations
   mysql -u root -p quiz_app < backend/schema.sql
   
   # (Optional) Populate sample questions
   npm run seed:questions
   ```

5. **Start the development servers:**

   Terminal 1 - Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üîí Security Best Practices

- Keep your `.env.local` file out of version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for database and Redis
- Regularly update dependencies: `npm audit fix`
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**WebSocket Connection Issues**
- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Check that the WebSocket server is listening on port 3001
- Ensure `WEBSOCKET_URL` is correctly configured

**Database Connection Errors**
- Confirm MySQL is running and accessible
- Verify database credentials in `.env.local`
- Check that the database `quiz_app` exists

**Performance Issues**
- Clear Redis cache: `redis-cli FLUSHALL`
- Check MySQL slow query logs
- Review WebSocket connection limits

For additional help, open an issue on GitHub with detailed logs and reproduction steps.
