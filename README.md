## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **npm** 9+ or **Yarn** 3+ (comes with Node.js)
- **MySQL** 8.0+
- **Redis** 6.0+

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tainyantun/APIQ-interactive-quiz.git
   cd APIQ-interactive-quiz
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the sample file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
   Then, fill in the required values in the `.env` file.

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   # Create the database
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE quiz_app;"
   
   # Run migrations
   mysql -u root -p quiz_app < backend/schema.sql
   
   # (Optional) Populate sample questions
   node populate-questions.js
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the WebSocket server will run on `ws://localhost:3001`.

## üîí Security Best Practices

- Keep your `.env` file out of version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for database and Redis
- Regularly update dependencies: `npm audit fix`
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**WebSocket Connection Issues**
- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Check that the WebSocket server is listening on port 3001
- Ensure `WEBSOCKET_URL` is correctly configured

**Database Connection Errors**
- Confirm MySQL is running and accessible
- Verify database credentials in `.env`
- Check that the database `quiz_app` exists

**Performance Issues**
- Clear Redis cache: `redis-cli FLUSHALL`
- Check MySQL slow query logs
- Review WebSocket connection limits

For additional help, open an issue on GitHub with detailed logs and reproduction steps.
