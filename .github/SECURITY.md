## Security Best Practices

APIQuiz is built with security in mind. We follow these best practices to protect our users' data:

- **Data Validation:** All data coming from users or external sources is validated before being processed.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** We use a robust authentication system to protect user accounts and role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Dependencies:** We strive to keep our dependencies up-to-date and use `npm audit` to regularly check for known vulnerabilities.

## Out of Scope

The following are out of scope for our security policy:

- Denial of service attacks.
- Social engineering attacks.
- Physical attacks on our infrastructure.

We appreciate your help in keeping APIQuiz secure.
